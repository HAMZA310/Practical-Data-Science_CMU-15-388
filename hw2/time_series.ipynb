Note that strings show up as objects. This is because the underlying implementation of Pandas uses numpy arrays, which need fixed-size entries, so they store pointers to strings.

    "## Part 3 Sliding Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compute a basic statistic for time series / sequential data, which is the sliding average. Sliding averages are typically used to smooth out short-term fluctuations to see the long-term patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it would be fairly simple to directly construct a list of all the sliding averages from the existing dataset, in reality, new TrueTime bus data is constantly becoming available. We want to avoid recomputing all the sliding averages every time a new data point comes in. Thus, instead of storing an unbounded list of datapoints, we will construct a class which does constant time updates as new data comes in. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifications\n",
    "1. Your function should not use more than O(k) memory, where k is the number of elements to average. \n",
    "2. Each update should do O(1) work. \n",
    "3. We will use a centered sliding average: we will average the k values both before and after the center point, averaging a total of 2k+1 elements. Note that k=0 will just return the stream without any averaging. \n",
    "4. Since the average depends on both past and future elements, the `update` function will not be able to output anything useful for the first k elements. You should output `None` during these iterations. We suggest you signify the end of the stream by calling `update(None)` k times, during which you should output the last k sliding averages. \n",
    "4. When at the beginning or end of a list, just compute the average of elements that exist. \n",
    "5. As usual, you should test the correctness of your code. You can do this in the same cell or make a new cell.\n",

    "Note: you may find the `collections.deque` data structure to be helpful. \n",
