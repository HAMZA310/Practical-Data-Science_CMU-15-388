Using these two representations, you'll implement two of the more well-known large-scale graph processing algorithms: Djisktra's algorithm for finding single-source shortest paths in the graph, and the PageRank algorithm for determining the importance of nodes in the network."

    "The graph we'll be focusing on for most of this assignment (and which we'll also be grading you on, we'll just be using a subset of the nodes that you won't know in advance), is a directed graph that represents the page links in the English language Wikipedia.  Specifically, we took the (pre-processed) Wikipedia dump from here: http://haselgrove.id.au/wikipedia.htm , which were taken from a 2008 version of Wikipedia, and we then selected only subselected only those nodes that had at least _500 incoming links_.  This resulted in a graph with about 24 thousands that had about 6 million edges between the nodes."

    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: in order to complete this question in a manner that works on the Wikipedia, you will _need_ to implement this function natively as a sparse matrix (i.e., you cannot construct a dense matrix and then convert that to a sparse matrix, but need to directly use the `sp.coo_matrix()` constructor).  The Wikipedia graph is is 24K x 24K nodes, which (assuming 8 bytes per entry, would take up 4GB of memory.  While it's not impossible to do things this way at this scale (it quickly becomes infeasible for graphs that are even slightly larger), it's a very bad idea, and just allocating this much memory will take too long.\n",

    "Finally, implement the PageRank algorithm using the adjacency matrix representation that you built in the previous question.  Reference on the PageRank algorithm is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank.  You should specifically use the approach described in the \"Power Method\" section on this page, which we also discussed in class.  This involves forming some initial uniform probability vector $x$, and repeatly multiplying it by the matrices:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x := (d P + ((1-d)/n) E)x\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $P$ is a transition matrix (the $A$ matrix normalized so that all columns have sum 1), $E$ is the matrix of all ones, and $d$ is the damping factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTES: Recall that from the definition of PageRank, when we reach a \"sink\" node (a node with no outgoing edges), we randomly hope to any other node in the network, so that columns of $P$ that have no outgoing edges are set to the uniform distribution.  To be efficient, you'll also want to avoid explicitly forming the $E$ matrix, and should instead use the fact that $E = 11^T$ where $1$ denotes a vector of all ones.  Use the fact that we can reorder matrix multiplication if associative (i.e., the fact the $A(BC)$ = $(AB)C$) to make this operation as fast as possible.\n",
